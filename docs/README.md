# MKDocs Simple

## What ‚ö°
A simple, default config for MKDocs with 
- [Material Theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) added
- Markdown stored in default "docs" location
- A github action config YAML that will convert the markdown files stored in "docs" to html, push them to an independent branch in this repository called "gh-pages" and then deploy this html to a free website hosted on Github's servers and domain name. 

## Why ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
This is a simple, "control" before moving on with examples of how to alter this default to fit different personal prefrences, advanced workflows and make MKDocs work better with popular markdown notes tools like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) or [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/), and many more.
